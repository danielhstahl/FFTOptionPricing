This repository does Carr Madan and Fourier Space Time Stepping Algorithms from <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/files/jcfpub.pdf">Carr and Madan</a> and <a href="https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/19300/1/Surkov_Vladimir_200911_PhD_Thesis.pdf">Sukov Vladimir</a> 
Requires my FunctionalUtilities repository, my CharacteristicFunctions library, and my RungeKutta library.
